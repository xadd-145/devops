DEVOPS
It is the combination of Dev-Ops ie.Developers & Operations.
D1.Plan-Planning everything
D2.Code-Using VCS like git
D3.Build-Building project using Maven & Gradle
D4.Test-Quality testing using Selenium
DO.Continuous Integration-Using Jenkins
O1.Deploy-Deploying the project
O2.Operate-Deploying & Operating using Kubernetes & Docker
O3.Monitor-Monitor software using Nagios
& Thn again planning

Devops principles, practices, roles, tools and Responsibilities

DevOps is the combration of cultural philosophies, practices, & tools that increases an organisation's ability to deliver applications & services at high velocity evolving & improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development & infrastructural management processes.

•Benefits:

1) Speed: Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. 

2) Reliability. Ensure the quality of application updates & infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for users.

3) Scale: Operate & manage your infra & development processes at scale Automation & consistency help you manage complex systems efficiently & with reduced risks. 

4) Improved Collaboration: Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model which emphasizes values such as ownership & accountability.

5) Security: More quickly while retaining control & preserving compliance Eg. Using infrastructure as code & policy. code, you can as define & then track compliance at scale.


•Principles:

1) Create a collaborative Environment:
DevOps brings together developments & operations teams,which implies an atmosphere of collaboration.

2) Automate, Automate, Automate:
Automation can benefit operations like Continous Integration or Delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure provisioning, security compliance, verification tests, etc.

3) Implement End-to-End Responsibility:
The traditional software development model gave software developers & operations seperate roles.  

4) Monitor & Foster Continous Improvement of process. 
Devops team implement CI/CD pipeline, it monitors apps logs, infra & systems. DevOps teams release a solid product & work to continously improve the product's performance, compliance & speed.

•Roles & Responsibilities :

1) Understanding customer requirements & project KPI's.

2) Implementing various development, testing, automation tools, & IT infrastructure. 

3) Managing stakeholders & external interfaces.

4) Troubleshooting techniques & fixing the code bugs. 

5) Setting up tools & required infrastructure.

6) Encouraging & building automated processes wherever possible.

7) Identifying & deploying cybersecurity measures by continuely performing vulnerability assessment & risk management. 

8) Incidence management & root cause analysis.


•Tools used in Devops:

1)Puppet: It is the most widely used DevOps tools. It allows the delivery & release of technology changes quickly & frequently,

2)Ansible: Ansible is a leading DevOps tools. It is an open source, IT engine that automates application deployment, cloud provisioning, inter service orchestration & other IT tools.

3)Docker: Docker is a high-end DevOps tool that allows building, ship & run distributed applications on multiple systems.

4)Nagios: It can determine the error & rectify them with the help of network, infrastructure, server & log monitoring systems. It is most useful tools of DevOps.

5)Chef: Chef is a useful tool for achieving scale, speed & consistency. This technology Ruby encoding to develop essential building blocks such as recipes & cookbooks.

6)Jenkins: Jenkins is a DevOps tool for monitoring the execution of repeated tasks. It is a software that allows continous integration.

7)Git: It is designed to handle minor to major projects with speed & efficiency. It is developed to to coordinate the work among programmers.

8)Saltstack: Stackify is a lightweight DevOps tools. It shows real time error quaries, logs & more directly into workstation. Saltstack is an ideal solution for intelligent orchestration for software defined data center.

9)Splunk: Splunk is a tool to make machine data usable, accessible, & valuable to everyone. It delivers operational intelligence to DevOps teams. It helps companies to be more secure, productive & competitive. 

10)Selenium: Selenium is a portable software testing, framework for web applications. It provides an easy interface for developing automated tests
